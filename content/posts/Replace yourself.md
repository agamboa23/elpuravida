# Replace yourself. 

If most of your job involves mouse clicks at a computer and you get paid more than the cost of the electricity running through it - AI will replace your work. The cost of birthing your digital workaholic self is plummeting with every new LLM model and every YC batch. Make no mistake, AI Start Ups are not looking to replace the SaaS incumbents you use everyday, they want to replace [YOU](https://www.artisan.co/blog/stop-hiring-humans). That is why you should replace yourself - at work. This requires you to  learn how to wield these new tools and turn into trivial automations all your tedious and time consuming tasks. You might use these new skills to accelerate your career or, if you hide it from your boss, unlock more leisure time. Let us not forget that even if your job is replaceable, your presence as a parent, a friend, an artist ... are not.
### Check yo self before yo ~~Wreck~~ REPLACE yo self.  

Is my job really at risk? - When I was at school around the 2000's, software engineering was a synonym with job security and a good pay - safe from replacement. Confident on this crowd wisdom, I graduated as a software engineer during the [ZIRP](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/LC-what-is-zirp-and-how-did-it-poison-startups) times, when recruiters would offer heaven on earth to anyone capable of writing a fibonacci pseudocode on a whiteboard. Today, [fresh university graduates are facing a contracting market](https://www.signalfire.com/blog/signalfire-state-of-talent-report-2025) while tools like Cursor or OpenAI Codex substitute most of the "Carpentry" work usually assigned to early junior roles. While there is still a strong demand for more experienced programmers, it would be reckless to assume this will be the case for the next decade. Not even 'replacers' are safe anymore. If your job involves more clicking and typing than manual work, your job is automatable. Whether they are automated or not, is just a financial decision.

How likely is my job to be replaced? - I spent my early career applying RPA (Robotic Process Automation) a.k.a. writing routines to replace people's work. These projects start with an assessment of different processes within the organisation and these are then ranked by their complexity, running cost and impact (what is the risk if something goes wrong?). RPA was limited to low hanging fruits and custom software to automate more complex workflows was too expensive. AI is commoditising ~~shitty~~ average software, which is arguably most of the software, which is most of the coding jobs. Like Sama said: We are ["entering the fast fashion era of SaaS very soon".](https://x.com/sama/status/1952084574366032354) With LLMs, the price of automating and running complex workflows dramatically plummeted, which makes your living wage highly dependent of the risk/impact factor. If the company needs someone to blame when the process fails, your job is relatively secure as you become a "[box ticker](https://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/)". If not, then your salary better be cheaper than the tokens it would be required to replace you.

Why do I care?: I had my fair deal of RPA and job reduction projects. I will always remember how in an elevator at Park Avenue, a client asked me if automation would leave many people without a job. My naive answer: - It will create more jobs than it destroys. His answer? - "I really hope not, that's not why you are here" - queue in [Rich Man Laughing](https://www.tiktok.com/@911pxrsche/video/7370966462342696224?lang=en). He was admirably honest and despite the optics, I don't think he is wrong. I do believe that RPA together with LLMs, now rebranded AI Agents, will get rid of more high paying jobs that they will create. I don't think we will have an employment crisis but more of a "[Bullshit](https://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/)" job epidemic (David Graeber - Bullshit Jobs) paired with [lower wages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ohZ74hdeI) (Gary Stevenson - The Trading Game). This idea deserves its own article but I highly recommend both authors as they give a very clear picture of today's job and economic realities. (If you are curious,[ this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXZP-Deel4) makes a good introduction.) Coming back to the question; I want people to leverage these tools to enhance their human experience. How you decide to do that is up to you; automate your job and advance your career (its hard to replace a replacer), use AI to filter the "brainrot" out of your social media, leverage N8N to apply to thousand positions, use it to scalp scalpers, to fight back for your attention ... I just want to show you how easy it is to use such tools, how easy it is to replace yourself out of the tasks you don't want to do anymore.

### Beware the sn**ai**ke oil. 

I am not selling a course and please shame me if I ever do (N8N automation is starting to become the new get-rich-quick-scheme for fake gurus). My payment is your attention and your feedback - nothing more. In return, I guarantee you handcrafted articles - 100% BIO writing. Not because I can do it better than ChatGPT, but because I respect the time you take reading it. Linked In posts in the other hand ... I might automate some of those. 

My next publications will include automation guides, benchmarks and experiments ranging from practical to utterly useless but cool. Use them for entertainment, inspiration or as a guideline to build your own agents and workflows, free up some time, make a side hustle or make your own whacky AI Agent.

I want you to replace yourself so others won't be able to. Take yourself out of all those tasks futile, meaningless or just boring. Place yourself in your own path and around those who value you most. For the birthdays, summer afternoons and magic instants where your participation is indispensable. Use this material at your discretion and let it contribute to the future 15h work week Kaynes envisioned, a future where replacing our work becomes easier but our human experience remains, as always, irreplaceable.
