# Replacing yourself. 

If most of your job involves mouse clicks at a computer and you get paid more than the cost of the electricity running through it - AI will replace your work. The cost of birthing your digital workaholic self is plummeting with every new LLM model and every YC batch. Make no mistake, AI Start Ups are not looking to replace the SaaS incumbents you use everyday, they want to replace YOU. That is why you should replace yourself - at work. You will need to learn how to wield these new tools and make your tedious, time consuming tasks trivial. You might use these new skills to accelerate your career or, if you hide it from your boss, to unlock more leisure time. Let us not forget that even if your current tasks becomes replaceable, you are not.





Automate the purchase of your next concert ticket to fight scalpers, keep that one annoying aunt busy with a whatsapp bot or monitor how your elected officials are benefiting or hurting you personally.  

### Check yo self before you (wreck) REPLACE yo self. 

The replacement formula. Am I at risk? 

RPA was limited to low hanging fruits. Software was too expensive. AI is commoditizing shit software, which is most of the software, which is most of the jobs. (website lists). Wrappers are not aiming to substitute SaaS systems or your excel, they want to replace entire departments in your company.

Why I do this: I had my fair deal of RPA and job reduction projects. In an elevator in park avenue the project lead asked me if our project would make them fire a lot of people. My naive answer: It will create more jobs than it destroy. His honest question: I hope not, that is not why you are here today with a millionaire laughter. He was admirably honest. He is not a villain. 10 years laters I realize I have contributed to this and want to offer an alternative. Its not a full solution, I am not a politician (like good old Goerge) or an economist (sup Steven). I want you to use these tools. How you use them is up to you. Automate your job and said shit all to your boss to spend extra time off the clock, use it to fight your social media adiction, leverage it to apply to inhumane amounts of positions, use it to scalp scalpers, to fight back on your aunt AI Jesuschrist memes ... Do the fuck you want with it, I am just a programmer wanting to see my job as a coder easier but my job as a people replacing agent way harder. 

### RPA died so AI Agents could live.
RPA was shit. What changed? 

These are old news, what has lately changed? what is new? n8n, make, celonis, 'agents', cursor, lovable. 


### What now?
Here comes the snake oil.

My next publications will include automation guides, platform benchmarkings and stupid automation experiments. Use them for entertainment, inspiration or guidelines for building your own automations, free up some time, make a side hustle or make your own whacky AI workflow. 

If you ever see me selling a course, shoot me, aliens have abducted me and replace me. As proof, I wrote this in polygon as a permanent record(remember blockchain? lol). I am asking you to learn this and put your finite and valuable time. In return I offer: 

* I don't charge for what I will share. All material, free, forever.
* I don't compromise. No sponsor, no bias.
* No AI Slop. I. t.y.p.e. e.v.e.r.y. c.h.a.r.a.c.t.e.r. 

Use this material at your discretion. - I want you to replace yourself. I want you to replace all the aspects of your life that are worth replacing, the ones where you don't find meaning. Keep all the other aspects for you and those you value. For the birthdays, summer afternoons and magic moments where you are not willing nor capable to replace yourself.

**Vote weekly on next weeks topic. 
Fucking wait until you see the spanish version: unhinged NSFW.

This is not for people with 'actual jobs'. Knowledge jobs are at a higher risk of automation and tend to be a bigger portion of Bullshit jobs (tm). These positions are easy to automatize with current tools and RPA have been having a meal day with such opportunities.

I will be writing every week with guides, examples, benchmarks and opinion pieces on the topic. I have no newsletter, podcast, or tiktok account to follow. Ask siri to make you a reminder or write it in a post it note. I am not tiktok hijacking your dopamine receptors fighting for your attention.


v1:
If most of your job involves mouse clicks on your computer and you get paid more than the cost of the electricity running it - AI will replace you at work. The when is a function of how much you earn vs how difficult and costly is to program your replacement. While your wages probably have not changed much in the last decades (reference on stagnated wages), the cost of birthing your digital workaholic self is plummeting with every new LLM model and every YC batch. Make no mistake, AI Start Ups are not looking to replace the SaaS incumbents you use everyday, they will cut the middleman and look to replace YOU. (Hiring humans reference). That is the reason you should replace yourself - at work. You will need to learn how to wield these new tools and make your tedious, time consuming tasks trivial. Telling your boss what you have done .. well ... that is optional. Of course your job is not the only place you can use such a powerful toolset - automate the purchase of your next concert ticket to fight scalpers, keep that one annoying aunt busy with a whatsapp bot or get notified when an upcoming legislation significantly hurts or benefits you. The finality and morality of what you decide to automate, is completely your ownership. You might use this new skills to accelerate your career or to unlock more quality time with your family. Let us not forget that even if your current tasks become replaceable, you are not.
